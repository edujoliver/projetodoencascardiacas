   - Patient's age in years (e.g., 45).

2. **Sex**  
   - Male (1)  
   - Female (0).

3. **Chest Pain Type**  
   - Typical Angina (1): Chest pain caused by exertion and relieved by rest.  
   - Atypical Angina (2): Chest pain with unusual characteristics.  
   - Non-Anginal Pain (3): Chest discomfort not related to the heart.  
   - Asymptomatic (4): No chest-related symptoms.

4. **Resting Blood Pressure (mmHg)**  
   - Blood pressure measured at rest, in millimeters of mercury (e.g., 120).

5. **Total Cholesterol (mg/dL)**  
   - Blood cholesterol level, in milligrams per deciliter (e.g., 200).

6. **Fasting Blood Sugar**  
   - Yes (1): Fasting blood sugar greater than 120 mg/dL.  
   - No (0): Fasting blood sugar less than or equal to 120 mg/dL.

7. **Electrocardiogram Results**  
   - Normal (0): No abnormalities detected.  
   - ST-T Abnormality (1): Changes in the ST-T waves of the ECG.  
   - Ventricular Hypertrophy (2): Signs of left ventricular enlargement.

8. **Maximum Heart Rate (bpm)**  
   - Maximum heart rate achieved during physical exertion (e.g., 150).

9. **Exercise-Induced Angina**  
   - Yes (1): Chest pain caused by physical exertion.  
   - No (0): No chest pain during physical exertion.

10. **ST Depression (mm)**  
    - Difference in the ST segment on the ECG at rest and during exertion (e.g., 1.5 mm).

11. **Slope of the ST Segment**

## üìÑ **How the Model Works**

The model was developed to predict the risk of heart disease based on patients' clinical data. It uses a machine learning algorithm (Random Forest) and follows the pipeline described below:

### **1. Training**
- **Dataset Used**:  
  The model was trained on the **Cleveland Heart Disease Dataset**, widely used as a reference in heart disease prediction studies.
  
- **Preprocessing**:  
  - Replacing missing values.  
  - Balancing classes using SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Oversampling Technique).  
  - Normalizing input variables to ensure all data are on the same scale.

- **Machine Learning Model**:  
  The **Random Forest** algorithm was used, which combines multiple decision trees to increase accuracy and prevent overfitting.

---

### **2. Prediction**
After training, the model uses the user-provided variables to calculate the probability of heart disease risk. The data are processed to ensure they match the format and scale expected by the model.

---

### **3. Classification**
The result generated by the model is interpreted into three categories:

- **Low Risk** (< 20%):  
  The probability of heart disease is low. The patient is classified as "likely healthy," but periodic monitoring is recommended.

- **Moderate Risk** (20% - 70%):  
  There is a significant probability of risk, and the patient should seek medical advice.

- **High Risk** (> 70%):  
  The risk is high, and the patient should urgently consult a cardiologist for a detailed evaluation.

---

### **4. Personalized Message**
Based on the calculated probability, the system provides a personalized message to guide the user. For example:

- **Low Risk**:  
  "Likely healthy. Maintain healthy habits and have regular medical check-ups."

- **High Risk**:  
  "High risk. Consult a cardiologist immediately."

---

### **5. Limitations**
- The model was trained with a small dataset (303 records), which may limit its generalization to other clinical contexts.
- The results should not be used as a definitive diagnosis. Always consult a healthcare professional.

## üîß **Future Improvements**

The project can be expanded with various enhancements to make it more robust, flexible, and useful in real-world contexts. Some suggestions include:

1. **Dataset Expansion**:  
   Use larger and more up-to-date datasets, such as **MIMIC-IV**, to train more generalizable and accurate models.

2. **Interactive Charts**:  
   Add charts that visually explain how input variables influence the result, such as SHAP plots.

3. **Database Integration**:  
   Integrate a database to store predictions, allowing for further analysis and patient tracking.

4. **Interface Improvements**:  
   - Multi-language support to reach a broader audience.  
   - Add more details and interactive examples in the interface.

5. **Full REST API Implementation**:  
   Make the API more robust and ready for integration with other systems, such as mobile apps or hospital systems.

6. **Support for Multiple Models**:  
   Include other machine learning algorithms (such as Gradient Boosting or Neural Networks) and compare their performances for different scenarios.
